Recently I started tracking my time on computer with [rescuetime](https://www.rescuetime.com/). It summarizes and categorizes your working patterns, but as a data-scientist-to-be, there's much more work to do, obviously.

## Sankey diagram

Inspired by a [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/7jaq1j/8356_hours_on_the_computer_over_the_last_4_years/?st=jbhpsbvx&sh=666d2aa8), I was able to create a sankey diagram of my own:

The data was collected over a 9-day span from December 14th to 22th, including 7 workdays. I have a deadline this week so I did more programming and less entertainment and gaming.

I could average less than 4 hours per day writing code. And for each hour I coded, 13 extra minutes were spent to look up references and documentations. It looks like my python skills are not that great yet.

I would do another version in six months and hopefully I could keep up with the trend.
