title: Scrum + GTD with Trello
tags: Dev

I have planned for a while to set up a customized system to achieve the following two things:

- Scrum, aka project management;
- GTD, aka _get things done_, aka time management.

After months of experiment, the definitive plan is finally made, thanks to [Trello](https://trello.com/).

### Trello

Trello is a visualizing tool to organize work (and life). The idea to implement scrum and GTD with Trello equals empowering myself to automate and self-disciple the following protocols:

- Visualize and sort upcoming tasks.
- Archive and recap finished tasks.
- Standardize efficiency and time management.

The idea to support [scrum framework](https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-is-a-sprint-in-scrum) is to implement [urgent important matrix](https://www.groupmap.com/map-templates/urgent-important-matrix/) in order to decide what to do in the current _sprint_.

Tasks will be divided into 4 categories:

- U: urgent. The whole task or part of the task must be done by this week
- I + nU: important, but not urgent. KPI related tasks that will expire at foreseeable future, but definitely not this week.
- nI + nU: not important and not urgent. No harm unless totally forgotten.
- Ideas: ideas are not tasks. They could be intuitive, but create no harm when totally forgotten.

Each category equals to a _list_, and each task equals to a _card_ in my Trello dashboard. Here is the rule to interact with the dashboard:

- After planning/completing a task: create/archive/label as `Done` _cards_ immediately.
- Every monday morning: move the delayed/unfinished _cards_ from `Urgent` list to corresponding lists. Rename and archive the `Urgent` list.
- Start of every month: Review the `Ideas` category and expired tasks.

Each _card_ in `Urgent` or `Important but not Urgent` should have one of the following label, indicating its current status:

- `To be started`: No inputs so far.
- `Suspended`: Started, but no inputs for at least 1 day (urgent) / 1 week (not urgent).
- `Await`: Wait for response from others to continue.
- `Done`: Task is done but should not be archived immediately.

There are two optional label for all cards:

- `Aone`: task is linked to an `Aone` task.
- `KPI`: task is in the perimeter of my KPI.

Finally, time management, can be done in two ways.

- With the scrum system, at the end of every KPI season, it's possible to review all archived _lists_ to summarize and metric the main targets and deliverables.
- Efficiency can be visualized via rescuetime. I have an article on using rescuetime, which can be [found here](https://jiaxigu.github.io/2017-12-22/time-on-computer-sankey).
