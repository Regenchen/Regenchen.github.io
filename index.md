Welcome to my web page! 
I am Yuchen Jin, currently a PhD student in Comparative Human Development, University of Chicago. Here, I'd like to share with you, in most cases, my research experiences and ideas in **Education** and **Developmental Psychology**. Broadly, my research interests include child lingusitic and communicative development, parent-child interaction, and in particular, how children become adapted to conversational turn-taking.
